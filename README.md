# IAAF-SC-estimator

* The instead of searching throught the 500+ page Iaaf scoring tables, this calculator can be used to find
points from a time and vise-versa
* additionaly, points can be used to normalize times between events in order to accuratley predict a performance in a different event
* I hope this provides useful for athletes, coaches, fans, and meet directors.
